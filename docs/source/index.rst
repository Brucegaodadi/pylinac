Welcome to Pylinac! This package is designed to help medical physicists perform linear accelerator quality assurance (QA),
mostly from TG-142, easily and automatically. Pylinac contains a number of modules, each one addressing a common QA need. Code is
compliant with Python 3, but not Python 2. You can read a bit about pylinac below,
or jump right in by doing :ref:`installation` and then :ref:`getting_started`! If you have questions, head on over to the `forum
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pylinac>`_.
