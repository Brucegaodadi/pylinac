Pylinac Documentation
=====================

Welcome to Pylinac! This package is designed to help medical physicists perform linear accelerator quality assurance (QA),
mostly from TG-142, easily and automatically. Pylinac contains a number of modules, each one addressing a common QA need. Code is
compliant with Python 2.7, 3.3, and 3.4 thanks to the `future <python-future.org>`_ package. You can read a bit about pylinac below,
or jump right in by doing :ref:`installation` and then :ref:`getting_started`!
