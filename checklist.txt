Version Release Checklist

- Run tests: tests/_test_all.py
- Increment version number in:
    - setup.py,
    - pylinac/__init__.py
    - docs/source/conf.py
- List changes in docs/source/changelog.rst
- If a new module:
    - Add demo files directory to setup.py package data
    - Add snippet to README.rst
- Build: run setup.py task..., `sdist` with option `bdist_wheel` to make a wheel
- Upload to PyPI: `twine upload dist/pylinac-...*` where ... is the version; e.g. `1.4.0`
  to upload both the .zip and .whl files.
- Create conda distributions:
    - Update conda/pylinac/meta.yaml file to newest PyPI version
    - Run `conda build conda/pylinac`. This builds and uploads; file output location: D:\Python\Miniconda3\conda-bld\win-32
    - Move build to `conda/win-32` folder
    - Convert that build for all OS platforms w/ `conda convert --platform all -f conda/win-32/pylinac...`
    - Build again for other python versions: `conda build conda/pylinac --python 3.3 --python 3.4 --python 3.5`
    - Convert those new builds to all platforms as above.
    - Explicitly upload other platforms with `anaconda upload conda/xxxx/* -i` where xxxx is the platform (linux-32, etc). Say `n` to replacing old uploads.
