V0.2.0 - 1/19/2015 -- Major Overhaul

-Python 2.7 support dropped.
    Python 3 has a number of features that Python 2 does not,
    and because this project is just getting started, I didn't want to support Python 2,
    and then eventually drop it as Python 3 becomes more and more mainstream.
-Internal overhaul.
    Modules are now in the root folder.
    A core module with specialized submodules was created with a number of various tools.
-Demo files were assimilated into one directory with respective subdirectories.
-VMAT module can now handle HDMLC images.
-CBCT module was restructured and is much more reliable now.
-method names normalized, specifically the `return_results` method, which had different names
    in different modules.
-Lots of tests added; coverage increased dramatically.

V0.1.3 11/11/2014 -- Added CBCT module

Overall

A module for analyzing CBCT DICOM acquisitions of a CatPhan 504 (Varian) has been added.
The starshot demo files have been compressed to zip files to save space.
A value decorator was added for certain functions to enforce, e.g., ranges of values that are acceptable.
The "Files" directory was moved outside the source directory.
-Starshot now reports the diameter instead of radius

V0.1.2 11/1/2014 -- Installation Bug Fix

A PyPI setup.py bug was not properly installing pylinac nor including demo files.
Both of these have been fixed.


V0.1.1 10/24/14 -- Bug fix, Optimization, and Refactoring

Several small bugs were fixed and small optimizations made.
A few methods were refactored for similarity between modules.


V0.1.0, 10/18/14 -- Initial Release (beta)

This is the initial release of Pylinac. It includes two modules for doing TG-142-related tasks:
Starshot & VMAT QA

Versioning mostly follows standard semantic revisioning. However, each new module will result in a bump in minor release, while bug fixes
will bump patch number.
